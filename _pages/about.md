**ZJU100 Young Professor**

**Assistant Professor of College of Computer Science and Technology**


## Biography
I am an assistant professor (ZJU100 Young Professor) in the College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University (ZJU). I received my Ph.D. degree from Peking University in 2022 (advised by Prof. Yun Liang), and Bachelor degree from Peking University in 2017. My research interest is at computer architecture, quantum computing, electronic design automation (EDA), hardware and software co-design. Recently, I mainly focus on the dataflow modeling of tensor computing, software optimization of quantum computing, hybrid algorithm design by mixing classical computing and quantum computing. I have authored over 30 scientific publications in top-tier conferences and journals including ISCA, ASPLOS, HPCA, MICRO, DAC, ICCAD, FCCM, TCAD, IEEE Micro. I also serve in the program committees in the premier conferences including DAC, ICCAD, DATE, FPT, HPCC, and serve as reviewers in several top journals including TPDS, TC, TCAD, TECS, TVLSI. 

<font color=red>I am looking for highly self-motivated PhD students, postdocs as well as undergraduate interns interested in computer architecture and quantum computing. Students with strong hands-on system building skills, algorithm background and physics background are especially welcomed.</font>
